# Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: A Comprehensive Guide

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating key concepts in supervised and unsupervised learning. It accompanies the Medium post "Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: A Comprehensive Guide".

## Installation

To run these scripts, you need Python 3.6 or later. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ofrokon/supervised-unsupervised-learning.git
   cd supervised-unsupervised-learning
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To generate all visualizations, run:

```
python create_visualizations.py
```

This will create PNG files for each visualization in the current directory.

## Visualizations

This script generates the following visualizations:

1. `linear_regression.png`: Demonstrates a simple linear regression (supervised learning).
2. `kmeans_clustering.png`: Shows K-Means clustering in action (unsupervised learning).
3. `supervised_unsupervised_comparison.png`: A side-by-side comparison of supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.

## Topics Covered

- Supervised Learning
  - Characteristics and examples
  - Linear Regression implementation
- Unsupervised Learning
  - Characteristics and examples
  - K-Means Clustering implementation
- Comparison between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Practical applications of both approaches
- Guidelines for choosing between supervised and unsupervised learning

Each topic is explained in detail in the accompanying Medium post with Python code examples.
